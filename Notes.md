Backpropagation based methods:
- Alternatives to BPTT include OTTT, SKTT, e-prop.
- Some biological feasibility to BP since the brain does send error signals. Top down reward system?
- BP not fully understood, even random feedback captures some of the effectiveness.
- 

Algorithms for training using gradient: SpikeProp, Chronotron, tempetron, Widrow-Hoff, OSD, SOAN, Slayer, relating to STDP, OTTT.


Other ways to improve accuracy:
- Using trainable axonal delay
